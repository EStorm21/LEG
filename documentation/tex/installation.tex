\subsection{Installation}
LEG processor development begins by downloading the code base to your local machine or a shared class drive.
The code base is small enough for each user to have a local copy.
After cloning the LEG repository, only a few off the shelf programs are required to get the processor running.
Complete instructions are presented here for Linux systems, but most functionality is available on Windows.

Several programs must be installed to use the full LEG debugger. 
However, only the LEG repository must be downloaded if you are simply interested in examining the source files.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Install git if it is not already installed, and clone the LEG git repository from \url{https://github.com/EStorm21/LEG.git}
\item Install the free Starter Edition of ModelSim from \url{http://dl.altera.com} or any version of ModelSim you may already have purchased. Note that in Starter Edition performance will be reduced and some features such as checkpoints will be unavailable. LEG has been tested on ModelSim version SE 10.3d. 
\item Ensure that GDB is installed on your system. Download it from \url{https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/} or through your package manager.
\item Install QEMU from \url{http://wiki.qemu.org/Download}. (or from package manager?)
\item Modify configuration files to point to your installation of stuff?
\end{enumerate}
