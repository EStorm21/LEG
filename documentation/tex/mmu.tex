\section{Memory Management Unit}
The memory management unit (MMU) supports most of the memory functions described in ARMv5.
The functionality implemented is fully described in section \ref{sec:mmufunct}
The MMU supports virtual address translation using Sections and Large, Small, and Tiny pages.

\subsection{Brief Overview}

The MMU consists of three main modules: the translation lookaside buffer (TLB), translation walk hardware (twh.sv), and the translation fault hardware (tfh.sv).

\begin{list}
\item tfh.sv: 
The fault detection has been tested using directed tests and waveform inspection, but has not been against qemu or while booting linux.
For this reason, it is disabled by default.
